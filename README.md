#### Introduction

This is a README file for an R Shiny web application called the Shiny Data Exploration Dashboard. The dashboard is designed to facilitate comprehensive data exploration, analysis, and modeling within an interactive web interface. It allows users to upload datasets, perform various statistical analyses, and build predictive models using machine learning algorithms.

#### Features

The Shiny Data Exploration Dashboard offers the following features:

- **Data Upload**: Users can upload their own CSV files for analysis.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes options for handling missing values, converting data types, and selecting features for analysis.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Provides an overview of the data with univariate and bivariate analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Generates histograms, box plots, density plots, and correlation matrices.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Supports training and evaluation of SVM and Random Forest models.
- **Model Evaluation**: Displays performance metrics such as confusion matrices, ROC curves, and feature importances.

#### Installation

To run this Shiny application on your local machine, you will need to install R and the following R packages:

```R
install.packages(c("shiny", "DT", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "plotly", "e1071", "rpart", "psych", "corrplot", "caret", "pROC", "ROCR", "pdp", "randomForest", "shinyjs", "shinyWidgets", "shinydashboard"))
```

#### Usage

Once you have installed R and the necessary packages, you can run the application by setting your working directory to the folder containing the app files and then running the following command in R:

```R
shiny::runApp()
```
